# Temperature-Prediction-RF-algorithm
this project was undertaken to predict the max temperature for tomorrow in Seattle, WA. In this data, we have access to one year of historical max temperatures, the temperatures for the previous two days, and an estimate. This is a supervised, regression machine learning problem. Itâ€™s supervised because we have the features (data for the city) and the targets (temperature) we want to predict. During training, we give the random forest both the features and targets and it must learn how to map the data to a prediction. Moreover, this is a regression task because the target value is continuous (as opposed to discrete classes in classification).
